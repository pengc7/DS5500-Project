The process of producing a new drug is a very time-consuming and expensive process, which could take more than ten years and approximately 1 billion dollars to develop a new drug. Therefore, it could effectively save time and costs to identify new drug-disease associations for new or approved drugs through computational methods. 

Many previous studies have indicated that similar diseases can be treated with similar drugs. Plenty of methods have been developed to identify drug-disease associations based on similarities. Some methods make predictions based on drug-drug similarities, which include chemical structure similarity, side effect similarity and similarities based on drug targets. Some methods use combined information on drugs and diseases. The disease-disease similarity could be measured by the semantic similarity of disease phenotypes (which are the symptoms and signs accompanying diseases) or the hierarchical structure of diseases. Previous studies have utilized conventional machine learning and deep learning neural networks to make predictions. However, their performances were not often compared based on the same dataset. In this work, we will build machine learning and deep learning classification models based on drug and disease information and compare their performances.
